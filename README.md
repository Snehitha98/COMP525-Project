## Accumulation Pattern
* We're going to use accumulation pattern to be able to get the data needed for
    our output.
* First, we need to declare and initialize our accumulator named
    **total_listings**.
     * Initial value of **total_listings** is an empty dictionary. We will
        populate our accumulator with data later on.
* Then, we're going to open and read **filename** that was passed in the 
    function.
    * Iterate through each line of the file by using readlines(). We're also
        going to start from the second line, since the first line is the header.
    * While iterating, we're going to split each line by commas.
        * This will turn each line into a list. This way we can access each
            element in the list.
        * We're going to get the data corresponding to the required information.
            * We need to access **neighborhood_group**, which is the 4th index.
        * Construct our dictionary (output)
            * Check to see if **neighborhood_group** is not in the dicitonary.
                * If it's not there, initialize its key and its value by 1.
                * If it is there, increment its value by 1.
* Write **total_listings** in a csv file so we can turn our output into a
    dataframe and use Altair to construct a graph.
* Return **total_listings**

```
## Accumulation Pattern
* We're going to use accumulation pattern to accumulate the necessary data for
    our output.
* First, we need to define and initialize our accumulator called
    **average_price**. We also need to define and initialize a dictionary holder
    that will hold the neighborhood and a list of prices. Name this dictionary
    **neighborhood_prices**.
* Then we're going to open and read **filename** that was passed in the
    function.
    * Then we're going to iterate through each line of the data, starting from the
    second line, because the first line is the header.
        * While iterating, we're going to access the index that corresponds to
            neighborhood. We're store that data into a variable called
            **neighborhood**. This will be the key of the dict.
        * Also access the index that corresponds to price and store it in a
            variable called **price**. This will be the value of the dictionary
        * Construct the dictionary
            * Check to see if **neighborhood** is not in the
            **neighborhood_prices**
                * If it's not there, set it as a key and initialize its value
                    with an empty list.
            * Append the price to the empty list of the associated key.
        * After constructing **neighborhood_prices**, iterate through the keys
            and values of **neighborhood_prices** using items(). Using items()
            will let us access the keys and values of the dictionary.
            * construct the accumulator's keys and values by setting its key as
                the neighborhood and its value with the average of the list of
                prices. We're going to import mean from statistics to be able to
                use the mean() to get the average of the list.
* Write **average_price** in a csv file so we can turn our output into a
        dataframe and use Altair to construct a graph.
* Return **average_price**

      which has highest number of reviews of that neighborhood group.
      Input : filename that has the name of the csv file which
              contains Airbnb listings.
      Returns Dictionary
         keys : string - neighborhood group
         values : list - name, price, neighborhood of that neighborhood group
      """
```
#### Setting up first accumulator
* Initialize local variable `list_of_reviews_d` to empty dictionary
   * keys are unique neighborhood group
   * values are list of reviews corresponding to each neighborhood group
* We use it to :
   * Get all the reviews for each neighborhood group
   * Further process it to compute and return the dictionary that has details
     of name,price,neighborhood for maximum reviewed neighborhood group.

#### Get the data from the file
* `file_ref` holds a reference to the file object returned by open
* `file_ref` is used to open and read from the CSV file named `filename`

#### Understanding the text file structure
The text file is organized in lines
* First line has the column headings
* Remaining lines have the Airbnb data
* A line corresponds to a spreadsheet row and has `,` as delimiter between
  the row cells

#### Solution logic idea
Three accumulation patterns:
1. First, we compute the dictionary `list_of_reviews_d`
2. Second, we find the maximum review of each neighborhood group and assign the
   value of `highest_review_d` to maximum review with key `neighborhood_grp`.
3. Third, we compute `result_d` by iterating through `highest_review_d` to
   produce the listing details for each neighborhood_grp
4. Return `result_d`


#### More detailed logic steps to compute `list_of_reviews_d`
* Iterate through `file_ref` to get hold of each line except the heading line
  with loop variable `line`
    * At each iteration
        * Split `line` at `,` to get all the row cells in another list, named `line_row`
        * Extract from the 5th element of `line_row` (at index 4) the country
            name and store it in variable `neighborhood_grp`
        * Extract from the 12th element of `line_row` (at index 11) the country
            name and store it in variable `reviews`
        * Use the histogram pattern to update `list_of_reviews_d` such that:
            * if `neighborhood_grp` is in `list_of_reviews_d` append `reviews` to
              the value associated with existing key `neighborhood_grp`
            * else, add the key and set up its value to a list that has
              the `reviews`
* close the opened file `file_ref`

#### More detailed logic steps to compute `highest_review_d`
* Use for loop to iterate over `list_of_reviews_d` with loop variable `neighborhood_grp`
     * At each iteration
         * convert list of reviews which are strings to list of integers
           and store it in variable named `str_to_int`
         * Now, use max function to find maximum review of `str_to_int` and
           store it in `highest_review_d` with the same key `neighborhood_grp`

#### More detailed logic steps to compute `result_d`
* Iterate through `file_ref` to get hold of each line except the heading line
  with loop variable `line`
    * At each iteration
        * Split `line` at `,` to get all the row cells in another list, named `line_row`
        * Extract from the 2nd element of `line_row` (at index 1) the country
          name and store it in variable `name`
        * Extract from the 5th element of `line_row` (at index 4) the country
          name and store it in variable `neighborhood_grp`
        * Extract from the 6th element of `line_row` (at index 5) the country
          name and store it in variable `neighborhood`
        * Extract from the 10th element of `line_row` (at index 9) the country
          name and store it in variable `price`
        * Extract from the 12th element of `line_row` (at index 11) the country
          name and store it in variable `reviews`
        * Use for loop to iterate over `highest_review_d` with loop variable `key`
             * use if condition to check whether `reviews` are equal to `str(highest_review_d[key])`
                 * use if condition to check whether `neighborhood_grp` are equal to `key`
                     * Concatenate name,price and neighborhood and set up value of `result_d`
                       to list with the same key.

### closing the file
  * close the openend file `file_ref`
  * Return `result_d`

```
#### Setting up first accumulator
* Initialize local variable `prices_by_room_type_d` to empty dictionary
    * Keys are the unique room type in the file
    * Values are lists of prices corresponding to each room type
* We use it to:
    * Get all the prices for each room type
    * Further process it to compute and return the dictionary that has average
      price by room type

#### Get the data from the file
* `file_ref` holds a reference to the file object returned by open
* `file_ref` is used to open and read from the CSV file named `filename`

#### Solution logic idea
Two accumulation patterns:
1. First, we compute the dictionary `prices_by_room_type_d`
2. Second, we compute `average_price_d` by iterating through
   `prices_by_room_type_d` to calculate averages
3. Return `average_price_d`

#### More detailed logic steps to compute `prices_by_room_type_d`

        * Extract from the 9th element of `line_row` (at index 8) the room_type
          and store it in variable `room_type`
        * Use the histogram pattern to update `prices_by_room_type_d` such that:
            * if `room_type` is in `prices_by_room_type_d` append `price` to
              the value associated with existing key `room_type`
            * else, add the key and set up its value to a list that has
              the `price`

#### More detailed logic steps to compute `average_price_d`
* Iterate through `prices_by_room_type_d` with key `room_type`
* Note that the same keys will be created in `average_price_d`
* The difference between the two dictionaries is that the values in the 2nd
  one are averages of the list of prices in the 1st one.
  * At each iteration
      * We map the list of prices which are strings to list of integers and
        store in variable named `str_to_int`
      * We use Python module `statistics` and its method `mean()` applied to
        `str_to_int` (which is a list of prices) and round it to 2 decimals
        and store it in variable `avg_price`.
      * we compute the value associated with that key in `average_price_d`

```
str_to_int = list(map(int, prices_by_room_type_d[room_type]))
